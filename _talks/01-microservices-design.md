## Abstract

Microservices architecture has become the de facto standard for building scalable applications, but implementing it correctly is challenging. This talk shares practical insights and design patterns learned from building and maintaining microservices in production.

## Key Topics

- **Service Decomposition**: How to split monoliths effectively
- **Communication Patterns**: Sync vs async, when to use each
- **Data Management**: Database per service, distributed transactions
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts
- **Observability**: Logging, metrics, and distributed tracing

## Audience

Backend developers, system architects, and technical leads interested in microservices architecture.

## Takeaways

- Practical guidelines for service boundaries
- Proven patterns for handling distributed data
- Tools and techniques for monitoring microservices
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
