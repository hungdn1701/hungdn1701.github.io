Since 2013, I have taught in the Information Technology Department at the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT), where I have been a faculty member since 2016. My teaching emphasizes systems-oriented, industry-relevant skills for software engineering practice.

Primary courses (regular)

- **Service-Oriented Software Development** — principles and practice of service-based systems, including service decomposition, API design, inter-service communication, versioning, and operational aspects.
- **Network Programming** — low-level and concurrent network programming with TCP/UDP, sockets, protocol design, asynchronous I/O, and performance considerations.
- **Web Services & Microservices** — API-first design, REST/GraphQL, containerized services, service meshes, and CI/CD for microservice-based platforms.

Other modules (short / elective)

- Web programming, databases, and C systems programming, delivered as intensive labs and short workshops to strengthen practical competencies.

Teaching style & outcomes

- **Project-based learning:** labs, group projects, and case studies that tightly couple theory with implementation.
- **Industry-oriented training:** focus on design trade-offs, testing, performance, and observability for production-grade systems.
- **Mentoring:** supervision of lectures, labs, and capstone projects for hundreds of students.
