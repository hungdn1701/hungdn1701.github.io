## Teaching — courses & approach

I have been teaching since 2013 and have been a faculty member in the Information Technology Department at the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT) since 2016. My teaching focuses on practical, systems-oriented skills students can apply directly in software engineering teams and industry projects.

Primary courses (regular)

- **Service‑Oriented Software Development** — design and build reliable service-based systems. Topics include service decomposition, API design, inter-service communication, service versioning and operational concerns.
- **Network Programming** — low-level and concurrent networking: TCP/UDP, socket programming, protocol design, asynchronous I/O, and performance considerations.
- **Web Services & Microservices** — API-first design, REST/GraphQL, containerized services, service meshes, and end-to-end CI/CD for microservice platforms.

Other modules (short / elective)

- Web programming, Databases, and C systems programming — delivered as focused labs and short workshops to strengthen students’ practical skills.

Teaching style & outcomes

- **Project‑based learning:** hands-on labs, group projects and real-world case studies that bridge theory and practice.
- **Industry-ready skills:** emphasis on design trade-offs, testing, performance and observability so students leave prepared for production systems work.
- **Mentoring & supervision:** I’ve taught and mentored hundreds of students in lectures, labs and capstone projects.

Course materials and syllabi are available on request. If you’d like, I can add detailed syllabi, sample assignments or a reading list for each primary course on separate pages.
