## Teaching (short)

I have taught since 2013 and joined the Faculty of Information Technology at the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT) in 2016.

1) Primary courses (regular):

- Service-Oriented Software Development — design and build service-based systems (microservices foundations)
- Network Programming — sockets, protocols and building networked applications

2) Occasional / short modules:

- Web programming, Databases, C systems programming

If you’d like, I can expand each primary course into a dedicated syllabus page later.
