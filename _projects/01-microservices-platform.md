## Overview

A production-ready e-commerce platform demonstrating microservices best practices including:

- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway with rate limiting
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger for observability
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD

## Architecture Highlights

- 12+ microservices (Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, User, etc.)
- CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- Circuit breaker and retry mechanisms
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring

## Key Learnings

- Handling distributed transactions with Saga pattern
- Implementing zero-downtime deployments
- Managing configuration across multiple services
- Performance optimization at scale
